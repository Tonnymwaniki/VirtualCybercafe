# Virtual Cybercafe

Virtual Cybercafe is a mobile app for Android and iOS. It is an AI-powered cybercafe in your pocket: tell an attendant what you need, and it helps with government services, CVs, documents, printing and payments. The same code runs as an Android app, an iOS app and a website.

## Stack

- [Expo](https://expo.dev) (React Native)
- TypeScript
- [Expo Router](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/) for screens and the bottom menu

## Getting started

npm run web      # open in the browser
```
